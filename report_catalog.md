## A. OHA CCO Incentive and Performance Reports
The Oregon Health Authority (OHA) uses quality health metrics to show how well Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs) are improving care, making quality care accessible, eliminating health disparities, and curbing the rising cost of health care. These outcome and quality measures are developed by the OHA Metrics and Scoring Committee and can be found here:   
http://www.oregon.gov/OHA/HPA/ANALYTICS/Pages/CCO-Baseline-Data.aspx   
Many of these reports are based off of the CMS 2017 Performance Period EP/EC eCQMs: https://ecqi.healthit.gov/eligible-professional-eligible-clinician-ecqms/2017-performance-period-epec-ecqms   
The default measurement period for the following reports is Calendar Year 2017, but the user can choose a measurement period of their choice.
